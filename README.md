This repository contains all the Dart code produced by [Arthur Barbera](https://github.com/tarturr) for the Admin Panel of the Villars Screen Data Broadcaster software. With this panel, you can have access to many settings of the [main software](https://github.com/Villars-Screen-Data-Broadcaster/screen_data_broadcaster) which will be useful for adding/removing data of the available server screens, managing screens settings, etc.

The Panel will run on any machine capable of running Dart applications with a Dart SDK between 3.0.0 and 4.0.0.
